## Description
This project was developed within the frame of the Front End Developer Nanodegree program at Udacity and greatly improved afterwards.

## Live
For a live version of The Freiburger Times, visit [GitHub Pages](https://vibueno.github.io/thefreiburgertimes).

## Features
* Mobile navigation menu (hamburguer) with no background scrolling
* Sticky menu on bigger viewports
* Back to top button with soft scrolling & fade-in & out effect

## Design
* Mobile first: the styles included in the main stylesheet are optimized for a minimum width of 240px. The file responsive.css builds on it by providing additional styles which make the site work correctly on bigger viewports.

## Programming
* **Fully responsive** (starting at 240px Unihertz of Jelly Pro, as fas as I know the smallest Smartphone widely available)
* **Responsive Patterns:** *Off Canvas*, *Column Drop*
* **Responsive Images:** showing crops for certain pictures
* **Responsive Tables:** *No more tables* & *Hidden Columns*s techniques
